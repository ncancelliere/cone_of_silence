This is what I would hang on the area near the developers to educate people about
what it means when a cone was out on our desk.

Using a 'cone of silence' is a great way for developers in an open environment
to afford themselves some "me time," free of interruptions.  Put out your little
orange traffic cone, put on your headphones, and no one bothers you.
